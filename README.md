Hello! My name is Kevin Christian Lao and My hobby is reading Informative textbooks 
about Biological kingdoms. Ever since I was an Elementary student, I am fond of 
discovering new things about Organisms on all six biological kingdoms. From the 
hobby of reading books when I was young developed my interest in peculiar things 
and eventually my interest hook up on biological kingdoms. Reading articles about 
new type of species of organisms or newly discovered lifeform is what fires up my 
urge to read more of topics beyond interest. 

Specific design patterns on each category of Design Patterns I implemented on my 
imple project are Factory design pattern, Adapter design pattern, and Iterator 
design pattern. Best Practices: Source file length does not exceed 2000 lines
of code, organized package, identions have 4 space and stays consistent, 
declaration and assignments. methods with mixed verbs which internal word 
capitalized,File name are in camelcase, classes and interface are in camelcase,
easy scanning and extra comlumn spaces
